# PiazzaHistoryKeybindings
Userscript to add arrow keybindings to navigate history in Piazza posts

## Installation
First, you need some type of userscript extension on your browser, such as GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey.

Next, Navigate here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/376513-piazza-history-keybindings

You should be able to click the installation button on that website to install this.

## Operation
On a Piazza post, simply use the Left/Right arrow keys to navigate the history of the post. Simple as that!

## Bugs/Suggestions
While I'd like to keep this script simple, if you have any problems or suggestions within the scope of this script, please open an issue here on Github.
